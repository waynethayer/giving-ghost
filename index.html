                <p>On June 8, 2018, after hours of driving under the sweltering Andalusian sky, leaving behind the haunting grandeur of Granada, the stubbornly snow-capped Sierra Nevada mountains framing the horizon, I had just reached the outskirts of Almeria when the news of Anthony Bourdain’s death came on the radio. The Mediterranean Sea had just come into view, out beyond the strange pale expanse of the &ldquo;Mar de plastico&rdquo; (Sea of Plastic), 20,000 distant greenhouses spread out over the desert coastline like the shattered pieces of a broken mirror, shielding millions of tons of citrus groves, nuts, and vegetables.</p>
                <p>When they mentioned Bourdain was found inside his hotel room in Kaysersberg, France, I turned off the radio, then pulled over at the next gas station to buy a pack of cigarettes. After three months on the wagon&mdash;my longest stretch in years&mdash;my nerves needed a crutch for the remaining fifty-mile drive to my destination in Vera, Spain.</p>
                <p>I remembered the former chain-smoking Bourdain had quit in 2007, after the birth of his daughter. &ldquo;I mean, I’ve had more time on this Earth than I probably deserve,&rdquo; he confessed in an interview about the subject. &ldquo;But now I feel that I owe this child who loves me to at least try to live a little longer, you know?&rdquo; Seven months before his suicide, while on camera for <em>Parts Unknown</em> in the south of Italy, he spontaneously lit a cigarette after a satisfying meal. Bourdain offered the moment to his audience almost coyly, but after holding the first puff of smoke deep in his lungs, his eyes hidden behind sunglasses, for an instant I could have sworn Bourdain got emotional. Abruptly, the camera cut away to a child’s hands with interwoven fingers coming apart against the sky, followed by a slow zoom toward the upturned face of a wooden crucified Jesus statue. Given his explicit reason for quitting, the imagery hardly seemed subtle. Over the years, in interviews, his own writing, and on camera, Bourdain hadn’t been shy about referring to or joking about his own suicide&mdash;nineteen times, specifically by hanging, according to the July 8, 2018 article &ldquo;Anthony Bourdain’s Long-Burning Suicidal Wick&rdquo; by John E. Richters. I was 11 the first time suicide crossed my mind. Once you’ve visited the idea, I’m not sure you can ever remove the breadcrumbs leading back to its doorstep.</p>
                <p>The shock of Bourdain’s death held an eerie symmetry: I was near the end of a Quixotic (the last of the giant windmills defending the horizon was only an hour behind me), 4,000-mile pilgrimage to the real location of the fictional Hotel de la Gloria, where, 45 years earlier in 1973, the filmmaker Michelangelo Antonioni had staged the murder of a journalist, documentary filmmaker, and author named David Locke, gunned down in his room at the age of 37 in a case of mistaken identity. Compounding the central mystery of Antonioni’s metaphysical detective story and fatalistic fairytale <em>The Passenger</em>, Locke, the miscast hero of his own story, had secretly committed a form of suicide only a week inside a different yet similarly lonely hotel room. </p>
                <p>Played by Jack Nicholson, Locke at the beginning of the film is burned out, at the end of his rope, lost in the North African desert trying to report on a war he can’t find, unable to connect with anyone he meets. The closest he gets to understanding is decoding the universal gesture for <em>do you have an extra cigarette?</em></p>
                <p>&ldquo;How far is it?&rdquo; Locke asks his rebel guide as they climb up high into rocky hills.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;They will tell you when you get there,&rdquo; his guide replies.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;Do they have arms?&rdquo; Locke asks.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;<em>Soon,</em> when we get there.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>But we don’t get <em>there.</em></p>
                <div class="grid gallery">

                </div>
                <p>And before we gain any more clues, almost immediately the guide abandons him when danger approaches in the form of a patrol crossing the desert on camels. On the way back to his hotel, Locke’s vehicle gets stranded in a dune. Amidst the silence, emptiness is everywhere around him, but it only reflects an even greater emptiness within. Locke is surrounded by a hopeless vacancy, pushed over some kind of existential edge. Whatever life force has taken him to this place has run out, and the many wars and conflicts he has observed have become faceless and interchangeable.</p>
                <p>After abandoning the last assignment of his professional life, Locke bitterly takes the long journey back to his hotel on foot. In the room next to his he discovers a man named David Robertson lying dead from a heart attack. They had shared a flight to the region, faintly noticed one another, then had a brief conversation over a drink the previous day shortly after they both arrived at the hotel. The stranger mentioned he had, “No family. No friends. Just a few commitments, including a bad heart,” adding that he shouldn’t be drinking before coughing portentously and suggesting another. Locke had been testing his Uher recorder before this stranger entered the room and accidentally recorded the conversation.</p>
                <p>“Beautiful, don’t you think?” Robertson asks Locke as they stare off at the desert.</p>
                <p>“Beautiful…” Locke repeats, dully turning the idea over. “I don’t know.”</p>
                <p>“So still,” Robertson says. “A kind of… <em>waiting.</em>”</p>
                <blockquote class="pull">“You seem unusually poetic for a businessman.”</blockquote>
                <p>“Do I?” Robertson turns away from the desert and smiles. “Doesn’t the desert have the same effect on you?”</p>
                <p>“No,” Locke replies in a melancholy tone. “I prefer men to landscapes.”</p>
                <p>“There are men who live in the desert.”</p>
                <p>And Locke has failed to find them.</p>
                <p>“I must’ve taken a wrong trail,” Locke confesses to Robertson.</p>
                <p>We never find out exactly why Locke felt double-parked in his own life, beyond the interstices of the past refusing to be pruned from his present.But we know he assumed a dead man’s identity, a complete stranger beyond a single random conversation the day before, who Locke gradually discovers was the arms dealer for the war he couldn’t find. The corpse’s eyes are open and Locke leans over him and stares deeply into them. He touches the dead man’s hair gently. Two faces are positioned opposite each other, life and death glaring into each other’s mysteries. Has fate delivered him to the right place at the right time, or the wrong place at the wrong time?</p>
                <p>The reading material lying on Robertson’s nightstand, with a skull on its cover, is a dangerously undeclared omen for Locke: South African author Eugene Marais’ <em>The Soul of the Ape</em>. In 1926, a Nobel Prize laureate named Maurice Maeterlinck scandalously translated and plagiarized much of Marais’ life work from <em>The Life of White Ants</em> (written in his native Afrikaans). Many attributed Marais’ eventual nervous breakdown and suicide to the trauma created by the theft of his ideas.What are the consequences for Locke attempting to plagiarize not just a book but an entire identity?</p>
                <blockquote class="pull">After Locke swaps passport photos, exchanges belongings (including a pistol he ominously discovers amongst the rest), and takes a set of keys from the dead man’s pocket, he carefully inspects Robertson’s appointment book.</blockquote>
                <p>Locke has no way of knowing it, but after turning the page from dates in Munich and Barcelona, he is studying the true date and location of his own death, via assassins seeking out his new identity of David Robertson, on Tuesday, September 11, 1973, at the Hotel de la Gloria in Osuna, Spain.And who is this mysterious “Daisy” in the appointment book that is supposed to be waiting for him at there, and then waiting for a call from him in Madrid five days later? Who are Lucy and Melina, the other women mentioned? <em>Are</em> they women? Code names? Ciphers?</p>
                <p>To find a life worth living, Locke has assumed the identity of a hunted life worth dying for. The gun residing in the dead man’s belongings is just the first clue. After its discovery, Locke casts a deeply accusatory glare in the direction of its former owner, lying next to an unfinished traveling chessboard in bed.</p>
                <p>Locke drags the corpse to his own hotel room and trades clothes. He then reports the death of David Locke to the authorities. For motivation during this quietly profound scene of transformation of identity, Antonioni told Nicholson, “It’s interesting how little people act when there’s no one to act for.”</p>
                <p>Locke’s only remaining guide into David Robertson’s life is recalling the conversation he shared with him the day before:</p>
                <p>“Airport, taxi, hotel––” Robertson had lamented to Locke. “They’re all the same in the end.”</p>
                <p>“I disagree,” Locke countered. “It’s <em>we</em> who remain the same. We translate every situation, every experience, into the same old codes. We condition ourselves… however hard you try, it stays so difficult to get away from your own habits.”</p>
                <p>Yet Robertson’s death has presented Locke a chance to push his luck and try.</p>
                <p>“Chance and chance <em>alone,</em>” Milan Kundera wrote, “has a message for us. Everything that occurs out of necessity, everything expected, repeated day in and day out is mute. Only chance can speak to us… Our day-to-day life is bombarded with fortuities or, to be more precise, with the accidental meetings of people and events we call coincidences.”</p>
                <p>*</p>
                <p>In fact, the Hotel De La Gloria never stood in Osuna, outside Seville; it was built and filmed in Vera, Spain, next to a bullring, where I was headed. Antonioni had ordered its construction explicitly to facilitate the shooting of the penultimate scene: a more-than-six-minute unbroken shot that took 11 days to film—one of the most technically arduous and famously daring in the history of cinema. “I feel the need to express reality,” Antonioni remarked in an interview with Jean-Luc Godard, “but in terms which are not completely realistic.”Roland Barthes commented of this impulse, “You (Antonioni) show a true sense of meaning: you don’t impose but you don’t abolish it. This dialectic gives your films a great subtlety: your art consists in always leaving the road of meaning open as if undecided––out of scrupulousness.”</p>
                <p>Antonioni intended the whole film to have the feeling of taking place over the course of a single day, suspended in time, “from early morning until some time before sunset.”Yet while this intention is not reflected in the date book’s inventory of several days’ worth of appointments, apart from the ending, <em>The Passenger</em> is filmed entirely in daylight, obscuring the timeline, lifting the narrative out of the expected path.</p>
                <p>I lit another cigarette and wandered a few steps away from the gas station to watch a distant kettle of Griffon vultures floating over something in the desert like burnt paper suspended over a campfire. When I got back to the car, more confusion and sadness over the radio about Bourdain and the public grappling with yet another high-profile celebrity suicide. I’ve lost family, several close friends, and many heroes out in the culture to suicide, alcoholism, or overdoses over the years. While they warn you it’s dangerous meeting your heroes, most of mine have ended up suicides, and I’ve been left chasing after ghosts. Mike Tyson was the first person to point this out to me and asked, “Is suicide a prerequisite or something?” We both started laughing. It had never occurred to me until then. We all gravitate to characters and stories we identify with; I’ve never been good at differentiating between living or dead or invented characters either. If the emotional stakes are there, does it even matter? I suddenly couldn’t help but see the similarities between Bourdain and the fictional protagonist of <em>The Passenger</em> I was chasing down in Spain. There was a spooky symmetry about the coordinates of their identities, both professionally and personally. I’d never made the connection before.</p>
                <p>The character of David Locke had also been the story as much as the stories he covered. The world knew his name, sought his insights, and admired the bravery of his perspective and authenticity. Both Bourdain and Locke were intensely ambitious about the work they conducted around the world and achieved enormous levels of success. Yet a hidden undertow of personal dissatisfaction continually accompanied their professional triumphs. In life and death, their mythic tracks seemed to intersect.</p>
                <p>“I’d like to be happy. I’d like to be happier,” Bourdain confessed to a psychotherapist in an episode of <em>Parts Unknown</em> that aired almost exactly two years before his suicide. “I <em>should</em> be happy. I have incredible luck. I’d like to be able to look out the window and say, ‘Yeah, life is good.’ I communicate for a living, but I’m terrible with communicating with people I care about… I feel like Quasimodo, the hunchback of Notre Dame. If he stayed in nice hotel suites with high thread-count sheets, that would be me. I feel like a freak, and I feel very isolated.” In the same therapy session, Bourdain mentioned a nightmare that had haunted him “as long as I can remember.” He is trapped alone inside a vast, menacing Victorian hotel with endless rooms and hallways and no escape. Desperately searching for a way to get home, the tragic realization sinks in that he can no longer remember where home exists.</p>
                <p>How Bourdain shaped his own legend with a self-described “lucky break” origin story of being fished from the slush pile at <em>The New Yorker</em> had always tantalized me, as it probably did thousands of other aspiring writers with enough rejection letters from far lesser places than <em>The New Yorker</em> to fill every inch of the walls rapidly closing in on us in cramped, falling down apartments. I can’t recall hearing even <em>one</em> other needle-in-a-haystack literary discovery story galvanizing anyone’s career. Impossible odds. Bourdain told us his mom had nagged him to give it a try. So had mine, hundreds of times. But after the first few dozen rejections, you’re already turning over whether the gamble ever had anything to do with “making it,” or if, like any serious gambling addict, masochism was always the secret payoff. Winning requires no self-awareness; losers can’t look away.</p>
                <p>Bourdain described himself as a Chuck Wepner type, the human punching bag palooka who inspired <em>Rocky</em>. But Wepner’s dad hadn’t attended Yale or worked at Columbia Records; his mother never worked at <em>The New York Times</em>; Wepner never attended Vassar, and also didn’t end up writing 13 books, including two wildly successful memoirs in a voice that sounded not far from if Holden Caulfield had abandoned his dream of living in the woods and instead gone to culinary school. Bourdain acknowledged in his first bestseller, <em>Kitchen Confidential</em>, that his story might end his career as a cook and was hardly likely to land him a television show or ski-trip invites from celebrities. He would settle, later on, for sharing noodles with President Obama in Vietnam… on his own spectacularly beloved reality television show.</p>
                <p>Like Bourdain, I endlessly devoured origin stories, especially of those personas notoriously forged in crisis—to take notes and dream, or at least sustain the delusion of having even a sliver of their worth to offer. I was never particularly concerned with their veracity; I was more enamored with the nerve and daring of their efforts at seduction and the careful curation of details—their attempts at crafting gateway drugs into the <em>rest</em> of their teller’s lives in the hopes of turning the world into addicts. Few of Rembrandt’s most powerful portraits took anyone’s pose at face value; the Dutch master zeroed in on his subjects’ <em>intention</em>&mdash;he wanted you to see the emotional scaffolding. Reluctance, likewise, is itself a pose, often one of the most seductive, and any seducer worth their salt has to be a sucker for being seduced. Lying, after all, is a collaborative act—every lie reveals the listener’s needs just as much as the liar’s, and the first victim of any world-class conman is always the same: themselves.</p>
                <p>It probably began with the secret double-life of Lewis Carroll, creating <em>Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland</em> while hiding in plain sight as Charles Dodgson, a shy, stammering math don at Christ Church Oxford. At 16, before he ever acted a day in his life, Orson Welles lied through his teeth to the manager of the Gate Theater in Dublin that he was a massive star on Broadway; nobody believed it, but his audacity charmed them and they gave him his first break. At 19, after World War I, Ernest Hemingway posed for history in a borrowed or stolen Italian soldier’s uniform. He hadn’t been a soldier; a mortar shell struck him while he was handing out cigarettes and chocolate. In <em>A Moveable Feast</em> he lied copiously about the abject poverty he endured first starting out in Paris, while in fact living quite comfortably and traveling extensively for ski trips and bullfights on his wife Hadley’s trust fund. George Orwell attempted to hide the elite Eton education from his voice with a more common estuary accent in public and over the radio at the BBC. During World War II, Roald Dahl’s first published story, in August of 1942, was called “Shot Down Over Libya.” Nobody shot down his plane; he’d crashed after not locating the landing strip. <em>On the Road</em>, contrary to Kerouac’s claim of having written it in three weeks and of championing “spontaneous prose,” was heavily edited by the author before it saw publication years after the first draft was written. Jean-Michel Basquiat auditioned for the art world in the role of a street kid from the ghetto who slept on park benches in Washington Square Park, while he actually grew up with a father who was a successful accountant who drove a Mercedes, owned a four-story brownstone, and sent his son to private schools. O. Henry, the pen name of William Sydney Porter, the wildly popular short story writer of twist endings, only gave one interview during his lifetime and lied throughout; his daughter Margaret only found out about his literary career being launched from behind the walls of Ohio Penitentiary (hence his pen name, drawing from the first two letters of Ohio and last two from Penitentiary), where Porter was being held for embezzlement on a five-year sentence, after his death; in the depths of despair, he wrote in one letter from prison, “suicides are as common as picnics here.” The prison’s chief physician reported he had “never known a man who was so deeply humiliated” as Porter. Literature wasn’t even F. Scott Fitzgerald’s backup-plan to his life-long quest of escaping his shabby Midwest beginnings in Saint Paul for glory––that was intended to be in the trenches of World War I, after football came to nothing in high school because he was too small. From reading his letters, it was years into writing <em>The Great Gatsby</em> before Fitzgerald even realized just how much of his own life and shattered marriage he’d cannibalized to inform Jimmy Gatz’s transformation into Jay Gatsby.</p>
                <p>“Dreamers lie,” Mercutio warned Romeo, shortly before his own death. And we know that when Shakespeare took to the stage to act in <em>Romeo and Juliet</em>, he hid behind Mercutio’s mask to deliver those words. Shakespeare also killed himself off before everyone else in the tragedy.</p>
                <p>As much as Bourdain again and again reminded us he was the beneficiary of a series of “lucky breaks,” who really believed him? Did <em>he?</em> That’s what interested me most about Bourdain on a personal level: the fascinating way he created, projected, and stage-managed his own romantic role and intoxicating path from the self-described “vulnerable, goofy, awkward guy whose only success socially was to be the baddest guy in the room” to winning over the hearts of millions around the world. Orwell was the writer he most cited as a hero, who himself once ominously warned, “He wears a mask, and his face grows to fit it.”</p>
                <p>According to a recent interview with David Remnick, counter to the myth, there was no slush pile submission. Remnick’s wife was friends with Bourdain’s mother and she passed the piece along directly. Remnick found the transaction <em>adorable</em>. “A mother’s ambition for her son,” Remnick recalled. “That was the beginning of Anthony Bourdain being published… I don’t know if there’s any way to put this other than to say he invented himself as a writer, as a public personality. It was all there.” Hook, line, and sinker, the world was addicted to Bourdain’s spirit.</p>
                <p>At the age of 44, Bourdain’s transformation from a debt-ridden, uninsured, chef in recovery, who told us his first major dream in life had been to become a heroin addict, occurred after that <em>New Yorker</em> story launched him into the public’s consciousness. Along the way, the “hyper-violent, junkie” Byronic persona he’d crafted as a romantic’s survival strategy––a tapestry braiding Hunter S. Thompson, Jack Kerouac, and the aforementioned Orwell––seduced the world, but I’m not sure how long Bourdain stayed under its spell. Something always remained unrequited. Bourdain once confessed, “Anybody that writes a book or goes on TV with the notion that they have a story worth telling, that people might want to listen to, you’re really already, by definition, an aberrant personality and a monster of self-regard… That’s not normal. That’s often very much at odds with being a functioning, well-rounded, good person in the conventional sense. That kind of vanity, narcissism, self-regard, self-importance, and cheerful willingness to examine and share your feelings… if you’re sharing your feelings, it’s not sharing, it’s <em>leaking</em>.”</p>
                <p>Bourdain was an obsessive cinephile, and I’d read that Antonioni—along with Truffaut, Kurosawa, Fellini, Godard, and Cassavetes––was one of his favorites. Maybe as a teenager he saw <em>The Passenger</em> with his parents, who he said made a point of going into Manhattan in the 1970s to see everything Antonioni did. I wondered, if he had seen it, if the film’s themes rang any bells for him. For Antonioni, the themes <em>he</em> saw in the story reminded him of one of his—and my—favorite writers, Italo Calvino, who once defined a classic as something “that never finishes saying what it has to say.”</p>
                <p>Calvino also wrote in <em>Invisible Cities</em>, my favorite novel: “Arriving at each new city, the traveler finds again a past of his that he did not know he had: the foreignness of what you no longer are or no longer possess lies in wait for you in foreign, unpossessed places.”</p>
                <p>Sooner or later, after returning to any place you love, you run up against the intrusion of time’s sneaky crosswind. It blows against the ambient reassurance the returns will be inexhaustible, hold more impetus, richer details, and, if you’re fortunate, deeper meaning and resonance. The crosswind whispers that there’s no special guarantee that another return holds more of what you first found there. The fleetingness of your encounter is suspended. It’s a reminder each return is as fragile as the life that brought you back along with all the life surrounding you––family, friends, acquaintances, strangers. Suddenly the complexion of everything streaking by out your window is imbued with the possibility that you might be glimpsing it for the last time. It was yours to always return to a minute ago, then it snaps into focus that you’re just passing through, spooked by the winking force of inevitability that somewhere down the line you’ll have to let it go.</p>
